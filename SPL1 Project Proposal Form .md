| **Project Description** This project aims to develop a **machine learning–based system** that predicts the **stress levels of university students** based on demographic, academic, and psychological data. The model will classify students into three categories — **Low**, **Moderate**, and **High** stress — using the **Mental Health Prediction (MHP) Dataset**, which contains responses from over 2,000 Bangladeshi university students. Each record includes features such as age, gender, academic year, CGPA, and scores for anxiety, depression, and perceived stress. The project will be implemented **entirely in Java**, focusing on algorithmic logic and mathematical understanding without using predefined ML libraries. <br/>The workflow includes: <br/>**Data Preprocessing** – cleaning, encoding, normalization, and dataset splitting.<br/> **Model Implementation** – Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest*(Optional)*, and Gaussian Naïve Bayes*(Optional)*<br/>. **Model Evaluation** – performance comparison using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.<br/> **Result Analysis** – selecting the best-performing model and explaining outcomes.<br/> *(Optional)* **Interactive keyword-based response module** to  provide lifestyle suggestions.<br/> **Objectives** To predict student stress levels accurately using multiple ML models, and to strengthen understanding of machine learning by implementing algorithms from scratch. <br/>**Motivation** The increasing academic and emotional pressure on university students highlights the need for early stress detection. This project aims to use data-driven insight to promote mental health awareness.  |  |  |  |
